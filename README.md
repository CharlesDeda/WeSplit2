# MVVM
This app is built using the MVVM state management architecture. MVVM is a simple, intuitive, and powerful way to manage state of your features.

The idea is that every feature has a view and view model. The view simple displays any data it needs from the view model, and calls methods on the view model to execute any mutation logic. The view itself should have zero mutation logic. There are exceptions obviously but it strives to do this.
